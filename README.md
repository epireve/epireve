# Olla, I'm Firdaus! ðŸ‘‹

**10x AI Product Manager @ Carbon GPT** | **Expert Generalist** | **Based in Kuala Lumpur**

I operate at the convergence of AI, software engineering, product design, and strategic managementâ€”turning visionary concepts into tangible solutions. With a passion for building impactful products, I thrive in dynamic environments where coding, prototyping, user research, and strategic roadmapping align to create meaningful, user-centric experiences.

## What I Do
- **AI-Powered Platform Enhancements:** Elevating an enterprise carbon accounting SaaS with intelligent features, leveraging AI-driven insights to refine user experiences and foster sustainable decision-making.
- **Autonomous Agent Frameworks:** Experimenting with agentic approaches for coding, product ideation, prototyping, and testingâ€”systems that adaptively assist developers and product teams alike.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP) Exploration:** Investigating protocols for local, secure, and controlled tool and data access, aiming to integrate advanced AI capabilities without compromising data integrity or user privacy.

## Core Philosophy
I believe in creating products that bridge the gap between complex technologies and real-world needs. Balancing design elegance, technical robustness, and business goals, I love my job because it allows me to constantly learn, experiment, and push boundaries to deliver meaningful solutions.

## Tech & Tools (Conceptual)
- **AI & ML Integration:** Employing next-gen AI stacks, model pipelines, and domain-specific optimizations to enhance product capabilities.
- **Full-Stack Development:** Crafting end-to-end solutions, from backend logic and APIs to front-end interfaces and responsive UIs.
- **Data & Security Focus:** Ensuring data-driven features are reliable, secure, and privacy-compliant, prioritizing quality and trustworthiness.
- **Product Management & Design Methodologies:** Applying agile processes, user research techniques, and strategic planning frameworks to guide teams from initial idea to launch-ready product.
- **Autonomous Workflows & Developer Tools:** Using agentic systems, code assistants, and versatile frameworks to streamline development cycles and improve efficiency.

## Recent Highlights
- **Enterprise Platform Modernization:** Scaled a carbon accounting platform from MVP to a production-grade, AI-driven solution, improving resilience, user satisfaction, and overall performance.
- **Cross-Functional Leadership:** Led teams spanning engineering, data, and UX to ship features that align with long-term product visions and strategic objectives.
- **Continuous Learning & Adaptation:** Actively explored emerging protocols like Anthropicâ€™s MCP, staying ahead of trends to deliver forward-looking capabilities.
